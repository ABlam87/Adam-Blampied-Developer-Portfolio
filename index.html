        <p>Hi there! I'm Adam, don't you look nice today. I'm fairly new to coding, recieving my ready-to-work qualification in 2024
          Honestly, Front-end Web Development is something of a big career change for me. For the better part of the last decade, 
          I've worked as a host on YouTube, fronting a variety of hobby and geek culture channels about wrestling, board games, movies, you name it.
          However, YouTube gets you down after a while, and so I've decided to try my hand at making internet things behind-the-scenes rather than in front of a camera!</p>
        <p>Below, you'll find all the applications that I've made thus far in my coding journey, as well as some 'comedy' placeholder images while I make enough stuff to fill the space. 
          You'll have to forgive the fact that I think I'm funny.</p>
